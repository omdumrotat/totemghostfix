# TotemGhostFix
Very experimental, try at your own risk. As far as I know this does not solve totem ghosting from very bad pings, only in edge cases where the ping are sufficient but the item packets aren't fast enough for the server to detect before the player die.
If there's any issues please open an issue and I'll try to solve it 
Requires **paper** 1.21+.
